# Introduction
This repository serves as a upload location of my Masters Thesis (coming soon) and the reverse engineered and recreated exploit drivers taken from [this post](https://www.badcaps.net/forum/troubleshooting-hardware-devices-and-electronics-theory/troubleshooting-laptops-tablets-and-mobile-devices/bios-requests-only/78215-lenovo-bios-auto-patcher-for-supervisor-password-removal) of the badcaps forum. 

The autopatcher scripts are the work of [Knucklegrumble](https://www.badcaps.net/member/316727-knucklegrumble), and the original drivers are assumed to be created by [Victor Voinea](https://www.allservice.ro/).

The goal of my thesis and repository is to understand how it is possible to remove the supervisor password and furthermore creating an open-source solution for whoever would like to use it.
